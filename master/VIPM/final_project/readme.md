# VIPM - FINAL PROJECT

### TODO
- [ ] improve model evaluations steps (more than just accuracy)
- [ ] Add CNN from scratch values to iterations.log (either via tensorflow or pytorch)
- Model 1: Clean dataset
	- [ ] attempt to improve training times
	- [ ] 
- Model 2: Degraded dataset
	- [ ] Data Augmentation techniques
	- [ ] Unsupervised degraded image enhancement
- Model 3: Shot in the dark
	- [ ] Allenare il modello su validation set
